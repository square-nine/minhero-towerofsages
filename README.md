This hosts all of the source files for Min Hero: Tower of Sages, as well as my progress in converting it.

All credits and rights go to Toy Chest Games, who are the orignal developers of the game


## layout
Inside the "Source Files" folder, I have stored the original files.

ALright, not exactly. I have renamed several files to make things easier to read. To get the pure extraced files, follow the instructions below:
First, Install FFDec.
Then, download the "Min Hero Flash File.swf".
Open that with FFDec
Right click on the name of the file in the sidebar, and select "Export".
Choose the desired output formats, and then click "OK".
Choose the destination and done!

inside the 'recoding' folder is my current progress in converting the source code from action script to python.
It's a long, tedial process to rework the original code, already being half-compiled. Any help with menial tasks (database writing, formatting images) would be greatly appreciated!

Inside the "Executeable" folder is the packaged release of the original game as an .exe!
Check the "releases" tag for more information.
