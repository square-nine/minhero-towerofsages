This hosts all of the source files for Min Hero: Tower of Sages, as well as my progress in converting it.

All credits and rights for the source files go to Toy Chest Games and their developers, who are the orignal developers of the game
The "Recoding" and "Executeable" sections are created by me, and feel free to use them!

## layout
Inside the "Source Files" folder, I have stored the original files.

Alright, not exactly. I have renamed several files to make things easier to read. To get the pure extracted files, follow the instructions below:
* First, Install FFDec.
* Then, download the "Min Hero Flash File.swf", which is the unedited original game.
* Open that with FFDec
* Right click on the name of the file in the sidebar, and select "Export".
* Choose the desired output formats, and then click "OK".
* Choose the destination and done!

## Recoding the game

Inside the 'recoding' folder is my current progress in converting the source code from action script to a python-based implementation.
It's a long, tedial process to rework the original code, already being half-compiled. Any help with menial tasks (database writing, formatting images) would be greatly appreciated!

## Executeables

Inside the "Executeable" folder is the packaged release of the original game as an .exe for Windows-based desktops!

If you want to play Min Hero on other platforms, please use your respective emulator/compatiability layer to run the .exe or .swf directly, or use another player tool like [Ruffle], or a website like [FlashArch] to run the game!

### For MacOS:
Use [WineBottler].
### For Linux
Use either [Wine] and use the .exe file or use 

Check the "releases" tag for more information.
