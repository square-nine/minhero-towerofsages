This hosts all of the source files for Min Hero: Tower of Sages, including a way to play offline and extra information about Min Hero in general.
Other Min Hero-related tools are also going to migrate here (like self-made mods)

All credits and rights for the source files go to Toy Chest Games and their developers, who are the orignal makers of the game.

## layout
Inside the "Source Files" folder, I have stored the original files.

Alright, not exactly. I have renamed several files to make things easier to read. To get the pure extracted files, follow the instructions below:
* First, Install FFDec.
* Then, download the "Min Hero Flash File.swf", which is the unedited original game.
* Open that with FFDec
* Right click on the name of the file in the sidebar, and select "Export".
* Choose the desired output formats, and then click "OK".
* Choose the destination and done!

## Playing
Follow instructions in the [Releases](https://github.com/square-nine/minhero-towerofsages-allfiles/releases) section for playing the game.

## Other info:
The `decrypted_bins` folder contains all of the decrypted `.bin` files from `database/binaryData`
The `images_sorted` folder contains easier-to-read images than the original names in `images_source`

If you are interested in modding any part of the game, I have started to create a document that compiles everything you will need to know! For now, just reach out to me (square_nine) by checking my contact details on my account page!

### Contact
Feel free to contact me (details in profile) for any specific questions!
There is also a [website](https://min-hero.nekoweb.org/) for Min Hero as well for more information!

There is some _special_ development being worked on to bring a remaster of Min Hero. So far, it is very new, but you can get updates that from the Discord server linked in the website.

Enjoy using this!
