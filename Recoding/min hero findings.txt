min hero findings:
logical constucts:
inside PresistantData, there are two files, which are both used to get a grab of all available data.
Dynamic Data is things that change across the course of the game, like owned items and other stuff
Staticdata is the things that stay constant. This includes the room layouts, and most constants.
Specialised constants are found elsewhere


The goto command doesn't actually branch through different functions, i think.
Instead of being a madness, they just try to provide a way to run certain pieces of code regardless of the conditions.
see this script:
if(!_loc6_)
{
   _loc4_.m_trainerRoomID = param3;
   if(_loc5_ || Boolean(param2))
   {
      this.m_trainers[param2].push(_loc4_);
      if(_loc5_)
      {
         addr47:
         Singleton.dynamicData.AddTrainerStarCountToFloor(param2);
      }
      return _loc4_;
   }
}
§§goto(addr47);

all the goto does is makes sure that the TrainerStarCount is always added to the dynamicData regardless of the conditions to get there.
soo, why do those conditions still exist, if they can just be skipped?


also, speaking of dynamicData:
there's a file called "Singleton", that has the variables designated! I think that code loads the data between the game and the saved data and data that is created during playing. They are held within the variables dynamicData and staticData. That's why Singleton.m_dynamicData gets referenced lots; it contains all active data!

Each floor has a constructor in TrainerSystem.as. I think it's quite cumbersome, so I'm going to try to create a database of each floor.
How the db works?:
The commas separate as they do in a csv. The minions are a little bit complex. The "@" sign separates the name from the attributes, and the "/" sign symbolises the divisions in the list.
kinda a FAQ:
Why is the final sage in the floor ID 6? Why not 4 or 5?
This is becuase the Hard and Expert Trainers (which are in the "Hard Mode") have to be set up, which is weird as the earliest levels should not need them. To better help the code, I have decided to always keep the Hatchery Sage as ID 6.
