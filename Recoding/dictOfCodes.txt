This file will record my ridiculous comment amounts


A minion is represented in the following form:

aMinion = {"ID": int -> the unique number assigned, to prevent multiple of the same name from triggering
           "name": name
           "level": level
           "currEXP": EXP -> the current EXP at a level
           "EXPUntilNextLevel": EXP -> EXP needed to level up
           "types": [type1, type2] -> their types
           "HP": health
           "ATK": attack
           "HEALING": defence
           "ENERGY": energy
           "SPD": speed
           "IntrinsicStatBuff": statType -> the stat the minion specialises in
           "Gems": [[Gem1Buff1], [Gem2Buff1, Gem2Buff2]] -> total equipped gems
           "Moves": ... -> a long list that details each move in the form below, including passives
           "CurrDOTs": [DOTName1, DOTName2] -> list of current DOTs
           "CurrBuffsDeBuffs": [Buff1Name, Debuff1Name] -> list of all received buffs/debuffs

}

ExampleMoveList = [Move1, Move2]
where:

Actual values
In the form: "S"/"E"/"A" + "!"/"%" + "+"/"-" + value means MoveForm
The first symbol is whether this only affects itself, or is treated as part of the power.
The third symbol determines whether the value is increasing or decreasing that attrbute,
the second symbol determines whether the value is a percent ("%") or literal value ("!")
try to abbreviate/shorten all of the dictionary IDs.

might convert it tbh
First letter: intial/dot
second: target
third: stat/effect (15 diff values: heal+ damage same sides of coin, same with energycost/restore, so less datapoints)
fourth: val type (literal/percent)
fifth: value (incl.positive/negative)

alternatively;
first: buff
second: target
third: stat/effect (persistent)
fourth-sixth: chance: i.e 080, 100, 004
seventh: val type !/%
eigth: value

example: BES075%-25
         Buff enemies' speed by -25% (75% chance)

DOT, by standard, defaults to the set TurnsActive. That should be fine?

example: ISD!-20 -> initially damage self by 20 HP
         DAM!20 -> DOT to allies increases armour by 20 points (it's kinda silly but you get the gist)

this should reduce the amount of lettering?

wait OOP might be better:
A move can be shown as:
Move = {
core features
        "name": movename given
        "Type": [moveType1, moveType2] -> what element(s) it is classified as. It can also be "Passive", which denotes the move as a passive buff
        "NumTargets": numTargets -> can be 0-4 for selecting, and at 5 defaults to all. The prefix "A"/"E"/"S" stands for "Allies", "Enemies" or "Self"
        "TurnsActive": numTurnsActive -> number of turns the move acts across
bools
        "VMBuffer": bool -> is there a delay between moves
        "TargetsAreRandom?": bool -> targeting randomly?
buffs
if the below two are just "null", then they are not buffs, simpel!. Buffs and debuffs are part of the same coin, so they can be merged
        "DeBuff": [[type, chance, MoveForm1], [type2, chance2, MoveForm2]] -> can debuff multiple things, or can possibly do extra debuffs
        "Buff": [[type, chance, MoveForm1], [type2, chance2, MoveForm2]] -> can buff multiple things, or can possibly do extra buffs
turn manipulation
        "Cooldown": int -> turns before move can be used
        "Exhaust": int -> turns before minion can re-attack
        "Accuracy": 100 (can change) -> chance of hitting (%)
system
        "Icon": image path -> the icon to display
        "MV-Icon": image path -> the in-game move asset
        "MV-Anim": AnimationType -> the animation of the skill    
general
        "MaxMod": [type, MoveForm] -> modifying the maximum of a trait as a buff/debuff
        "Initial": [[stat, MoveForm], [stat, MoveForm]] -> the instant effect of a move, i.e instant ATK, heal, speed, energyrestore, energycost, 
        initial can also have [stat, MoveForm, chance] for buffs/Debuffs
        initial can also have [stat, MoveForm, 100, numTurns] for time-limited buffs/debuffs
        "DOT": [[stat, MoveForm, extraChance, MoveForm, turns], [stat2, MoveForm2, extraChance2, MoveForm3, turns2]] -> all DOTs triggered by this move


ReflectAmount, Armour are all part of Buffs
Stun, Freeze are part of DeBuffs
ATK, CurrHeal, EnrgyCost, EnergyRestore, SpeedMod, Recoil, ClearBuffsDebuffs are now part of "Initial"
Recoil is just "S!-" or "S%-" with the attack var
ClearBuffsDebuffs is used as the "stat" in "Initial", and then the percentage after
HealBaseDOT, HealCritDOT, BaseDOT, CritDOT are part of DOT
