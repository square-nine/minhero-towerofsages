Files are saved in the .sol format at "~\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\#SharedObjects" on Windows.
The .sol format stands for "SharedObject", which means that it stores data useful for the game, but not for reading.

The "TCrpgInitialData.sol" file stores metadata about each save slot, like the name, stars, seals
The "TCrpgSaveSlot0" or other numbers from 0-2 represent the save files 1-3 from top-down.

WHY:
These .sol files are meant to originally be used for cookie data, so technically the save files are nothing more than elaborate cookies!

EDITING:
If you use .minerva (https://mariani.life/projects/minerva/), you can edit these files.
Open the link, and then click "Open", then "Choose File", picking a .sol file corresponding to your save location.

THE SETTINGS:
There is a maximum of 102 (0-101) minions to
